The aim of the project is to statically analyze Java source code for branching
and instrument the same for a forced execution of a trace path.

Please follow below instruction to see the working of the project.

1. Download a copy of the source code from GitHub.
2. Import the code into a project in eclipse, using import wizard in File menu, use "Existing project into workspace".
